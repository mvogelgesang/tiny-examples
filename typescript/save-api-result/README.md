# Save API Result

A quick example of fetching api data and saving it locally. Old copies of the data are stored in the `data/legacy` folder.

As a more robust example, there is a [GitHub Action](../../.github/workflows/save-api-result.yml) of the same name which runs on schedule and commits the results.
