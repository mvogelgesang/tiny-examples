# Promises within For Loops

This Tiny Example demonstrates how to execute a `for loop` which contains a call to a function that returns a promise. In short, the `for loop` must be wrapped in a function that returns a Promise.

Finally, [CLI-Spinner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-spinner) is used to make the execution of code easier to follow while in the terminal.

## Running

```sh
npm i
npm run build
